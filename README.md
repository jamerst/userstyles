# userstyles
Custom CSS styling for various websites.

You need a Userstyle Manager to use these, I recommend [stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). **I don't recommend using Stylish, as it collects your browsing data, and doesn't support UserCSS.**

If you find a problem, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/jamerst/userstyles/issues) and I'll look into it.

## Dark BBC News
A full dark theme for BBC News.

[Install via UserCSS](https://github.com/jamerst/userstyles/raw/master/dark_bbc_news.user.css) (Requires a Userstyle manager which supports UserCSS, e.g. [stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus))

Alternatively, [Install from userstyles.org]() (doesn't support auto-updating)
