# userstyles
Custom CSS styling for various websites.

### **You need a Userstyle Manager to use these, I recommend [stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) as it supports UserCSS, which allows for auto-updating of styles.**

If you find a problem, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/jamerst/userstyles/issues) and I'll look into it.

Alternatively, [Install from userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/164324/bbc-news-dark) (doesn't support auto-updating)

## Dark Warwick

![Dark Warwick Preview](dark_warwick.png)

A dark theme for University of Warwick pages. Applies to main site, Tabula and websignon.

This style may not work well on some pages, the styling of pages varies massively from department to department, and as I don't have access to all pages, I can't easily test the styles. If you're happy to test for me, let me know and I'll look into it.
